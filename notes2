not exactly a positive growth mindset:
3rd time being rejected or denied a promotion because I wasn't best friends with the Chef, or hanging out getting drunk in dive bars till 5am, or staying up all night playing fortnite, etc. It's why I decided to finally switch career tracks again, away from the thing I enjoy. No matter how much you know, how good you are at something, it always ended up being about who you know not what you know. Doesn't matter how hard you try, not everyone wants to be your friend. So now I'm focused on learning skills that allow me to work without as much internal politics and drama. Focusing on being friends with people who want to be friends, not the people who are in charge of my job or position.
