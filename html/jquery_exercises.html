<p class="codeup">A child is born with no state of mind
    Blind to the ways of mankind
    God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
    Because only God knows what you'll go through
    You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
    And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
    The places you play and where you stay
    Looks like one great big alleyway</p>
