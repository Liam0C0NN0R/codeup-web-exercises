                <dt>How old is the National Park System?</dt>
                <dd id="fAQ">The National Park Service was created by an act signed by President Woodrow Wilson on
                    August 25,
                    1916. Yellowstone National Park was established by an act signed by President Ulysses S. Grant
                    on March 1,
                    1872, as the nation's first national park.
                </dd>
                <dt>How many areas are in the National Park System?</dt>
                <dd id="fAQ">The system includes 424 areas covering more than 85 million acres in every state, the
                    District of
                    Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. These areas include
                    national parks,
                    monuments, battlefields, military parks, historical parks, historic sites, lakeshores,
                    seashores, recreation
                    areas, scenic rivers and trails, and the White House.
                </dd>
                <dt>What is the largest national park site? Smallest?</dt>
                <dd id="fAQ">Largest: Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, AK, at 13.2 million acres
                    Smallest: Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial, PA, at 0.02 acres
                </dd>
                <dt>What is the National Park Service budget?</dt>
                <dd id="fAQ">Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 Enacted: $2.98 billion
                    FY 2015 Enacted: $2.615 billion
                    FY 2016 Enacted:$2.851 billion
                    FY 2017 Enacted: $2.932 billion
                </dd>
                <dt>How do I obtain a park entrance pass?</dt>
                <dd id="fAQ">Fewer than one-third of the national parks charge entrance fees. You can obtain park
                    entrance
                    passes by visiting a park site that charges an entrance fee. Entrance fee sites have passes
                    available; we
                    recommend calling a park prior to your visit. (See the park search to locate a specific park.)
                    There are a
                    number of entrance passes available, including park-specific passes as well as passes that offer
                    entrance to
                    more than 2,000 federal recreation sites in addition to the national parks (Annual, Military,
                    Senior, 4th
                    Grade, Access, and Volunteer passes).
                </dd>
                <dt>Do national parks have guided tours?</dt>
                <dd id="fAQ">Yes, each national park offers guided tours that can either be hosted by the National
                    Park Service
                    (NPS) or by certified guides. A large part of the National Park Service mission aims to educate
                    visitors
                    about the uniqueness of each different park and how to enjoy each park to its fullest. Find
                    information
                    about guided tours at official park visitor and welcome centers or research for certified guides
                    in gateway
                    towns.
                </dd>
                <dt>How many people visit national parks each year?</dt>
                <dd>Last year, there were 327 million national park visits in the United States. Some national
                    parks, like Zion,
                    can become overcrowded during warmer months and require visitors to use park transportation
                    rather than
                    personal vehicles.
                </dd>
                <dt>How do I make reservations for camping or staying in national parks?</dt>
                <dd>Most of the campsites in national parks and national forests are available on a first-come,
                    first serve
                    basis, but we still recommend travelers make reservations online whenever possible. We highly
                    recommend
                    making online reservations for popular national parks at least three to five months in advance
                </dd>
                <dt>Are national parks open all year round?</dt>
                <dd>The answer to this frequently-asked national parks question is that it depends on the park.
                    While most
                    national parks are open year-round, there might be some entrances that are closed due to weather
                    or
                    construction.
                </dd>
                <dt>What’s the best way to plan my trip to a national park?</dt>
                <dd>There are two ways to plan a national park vacation. You can choose a special tour operator that
                    will map
                    out your itinerary for you or you can organize the trip on your own. Both options have valid
                    advantages. You
                    might get a better price on a hotel through a tour operator; however, you might not have the
                    same
                    flexibility and freedom as if you would organize your own vacation

            <h3>Grand Canyon</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> The Grand Canyon is bigger than the state of Rhode Island. The Grand Canyon is a mile deep, 277
                    miles long
                    and 18 miles wide.
                </li>
                <li>The most dangerous animal in the park is the rock squirrel.</li>
                <li>Visiting the North Rim and South Rim in the same day may be harder than you think. As the crow
                    flies, Grand
                    Canyon Village on the South Rim and the lodge on the North Rim are only about 10 miles apart.
                    However, to
                    drive between them through the park, over the Colorado River and loop around the canyon, you
                    have to travel
                    215 miles or about 5 hours.
                </li>
                <li>The Grand Canyon was carved over some 6 million years.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Devil's Tower</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Devils Tower was designated as America's first national monument in 1906 by President Theodore
                    Roosevelt.
                </li>
                <li>Devils Tower rises 1,267 feet (386 m) above the Belle Fourche River</li>
                <li>The top of the tower was first reached by two local cowboys who constructed a wooden ladder
                    system and
                    attached it to the side of the tower. Remnants of the wooden ladder can still be seen on the
                    side of the
                    formation.
                </li>
                <li>The tower is made up of mostly hexagonal columns, but some have as few as four or as many as
                    seven sides.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Appalachian National Scenic Trail</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It is the longest “hiking-only” footpath in the world. It is also among the longest continuously
                    marked
                    trails. The AT is marked with approximately 165,000 2 x 6 inch white blazes along the trail
                    guiding hikers
                    all 2,186 miles
                </li>
                <li>The Appalachian Trail is the largest AND longest-running volunteer conservation project in the
                    world.
                </li>
                <li>The elevation gain/loss of hiking the entire Appalachian Trail is the equivalent of climbing
                    Mount Everest
                    16 times.
                    The
                </li>
                <li>Less than 22,000 people have completed a successful thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail.</li>
            </ul>
